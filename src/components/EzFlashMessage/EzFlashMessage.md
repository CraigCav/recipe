Flash messages are used to display contextual messages related to content on the page. This could be an action that was just performed by the user or an action that should be taken by the user.

---

## Best Practices

Flash message should:

- Be concise
- Include only paragraphs of text
- Use the `headline` attribute when the content of the message is large enough that it could benefit from an easy to scan headline.

Flash messages should not:

- Be stacked. This can confuse and dilute the importance of each message.

---

## Content guidelines

Flash messages should contain relevant information related to the current state of the page. This should only be conveyed via text; no images should be added within the container of the flash message.

## Examples

### Success Flash Message

Success flash messages are used to highlight information that was generated by a successful / confirmed action.

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="success">
    <p>We saved that for you. No action required, just letting you know!</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="success" headline="We saved that for you.">
    <p>
      Looks like we’re having trouble loading this store’s data. Try reloading the page or contact
      our support team if this persists. I’m adding more copy to make sure this wraps to a second
      line for testing purposes.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

### Error Flash Message

Error flash messages are used to highlight information that was generated by an unsuccessful action or error that needs to be remedied.

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="error">
    <p>Oh Crumbs! Looks like we’re having trouble finding that order.</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="error" headline="Oh Crumbs!">
    <p>
      Looks like we’re having trouble loading this store’s data. Try reloading the page or contact
      our support team if this persists. I’m adding more copy to make sure this wraps to a second
      line for testing purposes.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

### Warning Flash Message

Warning flash messages are used to highlight information that was generated by a warning or caution the user to proceed carefully going forward.

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="warning">
    <p>Something bad could occur if you do that. Not going to stop you, just letting you know!</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="warning" headline="Something bad could occur if you do that.">
    <p>
      Looks like we’re having trouble loading this store’s data. Try reloading the page or contact
      our support team if this persists. I’m adding more copy to make sure this wraps to a second
      line for testing purposes.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

### Info Flash Message

Info flash messages are used to highlight general information and provide more context for the surrounding content.

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="info">
    <p>
      Something not look right? Give our Caterer Care team a call (555-555-5555) for assistance.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="info" headline="Something not look right?">
    <p>
      Looks like we’re having trouble loading this store’s data. Try reloading the page or contact
      our support team if this persists. I’m adding more copy to make sure this wraps to a second
      line for testing purposes.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

### Dismissable Flash Message

Adding an `onDismiss` event handler will display an icon button in the top right hand corner of the flash message that can be used to dismiss the flash message. This state is local to the component in which the flash message is displayed.

```jsx
() => {
  const [isFlashMessageVisible, setIsFlashMessageVisible] = React.useState(true);

  return (
    <EzPage>
      {isFlashMessageVisible && (
        <EzFlashMessage
          use="error"
          onDismiss={() => setIsFlashMessageVisible(!isFlashMessageVisible)}
        >
          <p>Oh Crumbs! Looks like we’re having trouble finding that order.</p>
        </EzFlashMessage>
      )}
    </EzPage>
  );
};
```
