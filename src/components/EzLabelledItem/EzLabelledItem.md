Provides a label that can appear in one of several positions relative to its associated content. Typically used to label an interactive element or a short string of text.

## Best Practices

Labelled items should:

- Be used to label a static piece of text
- Be used to label a control such as a Dropdown

Labelled items should not:

- Be used to label more than one child (unless being used with a single child that is a collection of multiple items, such as a Segmented Control)

## Content guidelines

Labelled items should

#### Do

- Use size="normal" with any position value
- Use size="small" with position="top"
- Use title case for the label title

#### Donâ€™t

- Don't use size="small" with position="left" or position="right"
