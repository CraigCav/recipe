- fix: EzLayout `columns` styles should only apply to `tile` layouts. Closes [#616](https://github.com/ezcater/recipe/issues/616).
- fix: Issue causing `EzLayout[layout="stack"]` to horizontally collapse instead of filling the width of the parent element. Closes [#619](https://github.com/ezcater/recipe/issues/619).
- fix: apply range media queries to `EzCard[imagePosition]` (instead of max-width queries), to avoid SSR order-of-insertion issues.
