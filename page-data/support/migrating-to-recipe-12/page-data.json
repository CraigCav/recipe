Ideally styles would be co-located and packaged with components, such that applications could use Recipe components without having to \"remember\" to manually include a separate stylesheet-per-component, or maintain a large global stylesheet.</p>\n<p>The Recipe team made the choice to utilize the <a href=\"https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction\">emotion</a> css-in-js library, as it had already been well established as a tooling choice in ezcater's core web sites and web applications. Using emotion within Recipe solved the packaging and distribution problem, without requiring any additional configuration overhead for our existing applications.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the Emotion maintainers shipped a major release of the emotion libraries (v10), adding some very useful new features and updating the internals for compatibility with React (by removing usage of deprecated APIs). Unfortunately for us as consumers of Emotion, this change required a significant update to Recipe that needed tight coordination with downstream applications. </p>\n<p>Updating any major peer-dependency is somewhat challenging, and this situation was no different; applications could not upgrade Emotion without a corresponding Recipe release, but Recipe couldn't be upgraded without either cutting off support for applications that were not yet using the latest version of Emotion. üêî ü•ö</p>\n<p>Once again, we find ourselves in a similar situation - the Emotion team have shipped a major release with breaking changes (v11), and progress in the react tooling ecosystem (supporting webpack 5) necessitates that we discontinue use of the prior version for compatibility.</p>\n<p>This leaves us two options, upgrade emotion in Recipe (and all downstream applications), or remove Recipe's dependency on Emotion to unblock downstream applications from their own upgrades.</p>\n<p>The Recipe team have chosen to do the latter.
