## Unreleased Changes

#### Breaking changes.

#### New components

#### Enhancements

#### Design updates

- Increased spacing of grouped links within EzNavigation to increase hit-target size.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix: Change build target for @recipe-ui/theme-marketplace to support ES5 syntax. This allows downstream applications to include Recipe without running build steps within `node_modules`.
- Fix: EzNavigation utility links were clipped when logo size was taller than 70px.
- Fix: EzNavigation links with `onClick` and no `href` now render as buttons, rather than links.

#### Documentation

- Fixed documentation for EzProvider to show the correct named import from `@recipe-ui/theme-marketplace`.

#### Dependency upgrades

#### Development workflow
