If a component is flexible, there will be more ways others can use it in the future, right? But flexibility works in opposition to consistency. Flexibility is an opportunity for downstream applications to do something unexpected, putting a cognitive burden on the end user.</li>\n<li>Flexibility is a one way door. If you ship an overly flexible component, it's hard to roll back once adopted by downstream applications.</li>\n<li>We prefer to start with a simple opinionated component and extend it later when a proven need arises.</li>\n<li>Be opinionated. Is that button always going to say \"Close\"? In that case don't take a prop for it, let the Recipe component own the text.</li>\n<li>Is your component going to come in multiple colors? Don't accept arbitrary values, instead limit it to an opinionated set using semantic property values. For example, a <code>use</code> property that accepts values like <code>info</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code> is preferrable to a <code>color</code> property that accepts hex color codes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"documentation-first\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#documentation-first\" aria-label=\"documentation first permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Documentation first</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We always start by writing the documentation page for the living style guide. Having detailed usage guidelines and a complete API promotes clear systems thinking and is a huge timesaver for preventing churn in the PR.</li>\n<li>APIs are hard to take back. Getting to a good API is the most important function of the governance process.</li>\n<li>Try to reuse property names across components where appropriate and structure similar properties similarly. For instance, we have a number of components that accept links in a consistent way that supports both URLs and React router.</li>\n<li>Good names facilitate communication. Ideally engineers, designers, and end users would all use the same name for your component. When naming a new component it's worth thinking about: common names for that widget in the industry, how different team members refer to it, anything you know about how users refer to it.</li>\n<li>Pave the cowpaths. You will have an uphill battle if you pick a name that is different than one teams are already using.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"keep-evolving\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#keep-evolving\" aria-label=\"keep evolving permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Keep evolving</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipe is a living system.

Once downstream applications start using the API, it can be hard to change. However, internal implemenation decisions within Recipe are usually easier to take back and evolve without disrupting client applications. Here are some examples to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a new, optional prop can be done with affecting existing client applications.</li>\n<li>A prop that accepts multiple values makes it easy to extend with additional values in the future. However, you should weigh the likelihood of needing to extend. In some cases a simple boolean flag prop makes for a cleaner API. Take a look at the API for <a href=\"/recipe/components/ez-button\">Button</a> for an example of how a mix of flags and extensible props was carefully chosen.</li>\n<li>Some animations, like rollover states, are easy to add later. However, if you are trying to animate a state change, such as closing a modal, it may require coordinate with the parent application to prevent the component being unmounted before the animation runs. If you think such animations will be important for your component, it was worth considering the API implications during the original design phase.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's a system</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decisions you make about one component can have impacts on the overall cohesion of the system. For example, using color in a new way for your component might make sense in isolation, but you also need to consider whether this creates confusion around the function of existing controls that may use color differently. It may be that your new approach is better overall, in which case you should advocate for evolving the whole family of impacted components.</li>\n<li>Systems thinking is hard. If you're passionate about a new concept, keep thinking about how to make it more broadly applicable and integrated into Recipe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't worry about localization (yet)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preparing for localization is explicitly not a 2019 focus for ezCater.</li>\n<li>It is totally fine and in fact desirable to have English strings within your components. We do encourage however, that these translated strings are isolated from component rendering logic. Recipe internally uses a <code>useTranslation</code> hook to assist with the process of interpolating dynamic values into static messages.</li>\n<li>Eventually we will develop a strategy for initializing Recipe with a locale so that any strings owned by Recipe can be appropriately localized.</li>\n<li>Remember that localization is a presentational problem too, so it is definitely within the concern scope for a design system. Think about languages with longer average word length, or even with a different reading order (right to left languages).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"principles-for-using-recipe","style":"position:relative;"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#principles-for-using-recipe","ariaLabel":"principles for using recipe permalink","className":["anchor","before"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"svg","properties":{"ariaHidden":"true","focusable":"false","height":"16","version":"1.1","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","width":"16"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"path","properties":{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Principles for using Recipe"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"freedom-through-limitation","style":"position:relative;"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#freedom-through-limitation","ariaLabel":"freedom through limitation permalink","className":["anchor","before"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"svg","properties":{"ariaHidden":"true","focusable":"false","height":"16","version":"1.1","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","width":"16"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"path","properties":{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Freedom through limitation"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Existing component libraries (like Semantic or Bootstrap, etc.) provide a huge variety of options for designers and developers to use.
